## legos

{picture of legos strewn about}
so i was supposed to do this share in feb. but i've had to reschedule this TKTK times. thanks to biz, TKTK, TKTK, TKTK, and TKTK who have swapped with me along the way.

i used this share as an opportunity to nerd out a bit. something i don't get to do all the time.

so...legos are big in my family...

who here has ever taken a statistics class? come on, be honest...

not me. that's right, i studied math and engineering in undergrad and grad school, published papers with sophisticated analyses and machine learning algorithms, and co-founded a data science company that some fool bought, but i haven't taken a statistics class.

## everything i've ever learned has been through simulations of toy models

coin flip example -> more better-er

random walks -> BD pitch to Dialog Tech CFO... meh?

## toy models... hmmmmmmmm

random lego assembly

compare height width of footprint to ian's contraptions

how random of a builder is ian?

how likely that lego designs are
